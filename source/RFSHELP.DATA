RFSLIB  ******************* RFSLIB Main Help ***************************
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  The RFSLIB product is an extension of the CICS/REXX support
RFSLIB  already provided by IBM free of charge with the IBM CICS
RFSLIB  Transaction Server for VSE/ESA V1.1.1 product.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  The RFSLIB main screen is a member listing and selection
RFSLIB  screen similar to that provided by IBM in the z/VSE
RFSLIB  Interactive Interface for accessing an ICCF Library.  This
RFSLIB  main screen provides a directory listing of the contents of
RFSLIB  the current CICS/REXX File System (or RFS) directory.  From
RFSLIB  this directory listing the user can select members for
RFSLIB  viewing and editing as well as several other functions.  In
RFSLIB  addition a Command Line area is available for accessing
RFSLIB  specific commands which have been provided to add functions
RFSLIB  and features to the CICS/REXX environment.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  The screen is broken into several areas.  These are...
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  TOP AREA
RFSLIB  ========
RFSLIB  The top of the screen contains a list of selections
RFSLIB  available which can be placed in the prefix area in
RFSLIB  front of a file or directory to perfrom a specific
RFSLIB  operation.  These include...
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  1=EDIT
RFSLIB  Open the selected file in the CICS/REXX full screen
RFSLIB  editor.  This editor is very close in function and
RFSLIB  features to the VM/CMS XEDIT editor. More information on
RFSLIB  the Editor can be obtained by entering "HELP EDITOR"
RFSLIB  in the Command Line area. The editor can also be tailored
RFSLIB  to an individual user's preferences.  The user can create
RFSLIB  a file in their "home" directory called EDITPROF.EXEC which
RFSLIB  can contain CICS/REXX commands that can be used to
RFSLIB  customize the editor.
RFSLIB  For example...
RFSLIB  ADDRESS EDITSVR
RFSLIB  'SET CASE MIXED RESPECT'
RFSLIB  'SYNONYM BOT BOTTOM'
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  Please see your System Administrator for more information.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  2=CHANGETO
RFSLIB  This option is only available against a directory and
RFSLIB  allows for changing the current directory to the
RFSLIB  the selected directory.  Once selected the display
RFSLIB  will refresh to now provide a directory listing of the
RFSLIB  selected directory.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  3=PRINT
RFSLIB  This option is only available against files (not
RFSLIB  directories) and spools a copy of the selected file to
RFSLIB  the VSE POWER List Queue for printing.  The attributes
RFSLIB  used to spool the data to VSE POWER can be controlled
RFSLIB  by the user.  The default values are specified by the
RFSLIB  System Administrator in the RFSLIB.CONFIG member. The
RFSLIB  user can override there own default values by creating a
RFSLIB  file in the "home" directory called PRINT.PROFILE.
RFSLIB  The PRINT.PROFILE file can contain any of the
RFSLIB  following statements...
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  NAME = nnnnnnnn
RFSLIB  CLASS = c
RFSLIB  DISP = d
RFSLIB  PRI = p
RFSLIB  DEST = dddddddd
RFSLIB  FORM = ffff
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  Please see your System Administrator for more information.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  4=COPY/MOVE
RFSLIB  This option provides the user the ability to perform a
RFSLIB  COPY or MOVE operation against a file.  A separate
RFSLIB  panel screen is displayed providing the user with
RFSLIB  the option to select the target filename and folder of
RFSLIB  the COPY or MOVE operation.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  5=DELETE
RFSLIB  This option allows for the deletion of the selected
RFSLIB  file or directory.  Please note that a delete can not
RFSLIB  be performed on a directory that contains any files.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  6=RENAME
RFSLIB  This option allows the user to rename the selected
RFSLIB  file or directory.  The NEWNAME (and optionally the
RFSLIB  NEWTYPE) field is required.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  7=SUBMIT
RFSLIB  This option allows the user to submit the selected
RFSLIB  file to the VSE POWER Reader Queue for execution. This
RFSLIB  option can only be performed against files with the
RFSLIB  FILETYPE of "JCL".  In addition this option requires
RFSLIB  special security permissions to be authorized to submit
RFSLIB  jobs to the VSE POWER Reader Queue.  Additional security
RFSLIB  permissions are needed if the JECL JOBCARD contains a SEC,
RFSLIB  FROM or LDEST parameter or if the VSE JCL contains a
RFSLIB  "// ID" statement.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  8=COMPILE
RFSLIB  This option provides the user the ability to perform
RFSLIB  one of the available programming language functions.
RFSLIB  A separate panel screen is displayed presenting the
RFSLIB  user with the options available.  These options are
RFSLIB  installation specific.  This option requires special
RFSLIB  security permissions as well because it involves generating
RFSLIB  and subimtting JCL to VSE POWER for execution. Please contact
RFSLIB  your System Administrator for more information.
RFSLIB
RFSLIB  9=DISPLAY
RFSLIB  This option allows the user to select the member for
RFSLIB  display.  The dislay function provides all the

EDITOR  ************** CICS/REXX Full Screen Editor ********************
EDITOR
EDITOR  Overview
EDITOR  ========
EDITOR  The CICS/REXX Full Screen Editor is patterned after VM/CMS
EDITOR  XEDIT. The editor is provided so data can be created,
EDITOR  updated and viewed from within the CICS environment.
EDITOR
EDITOR  The CICS/REXX editor includes several prefix commands (for
EDITOR  example: C, CC, M, MM, B, A, F, P) in common with the XEDIT
EDITOR  editor.
EDITOR
EDITOR  While in an editor session, commands entered on the command
EDITOR  line can be chained by placing a ";" between each command.
EDITOR  Support is also provided for macros written in REXX. This
EDITOR  lets you customize editor settings with a profile exec or
EDITOR  add new commandes to the editor.
EDITOR
EDITOR  Screen Format
EDITOR  =============
EDITOR  The CICS/REXX Editor screen is laid out as follows...
EDITOR
EDITOR  The first line is reserved for the TITLE LINE and contains
EDITOR  the following:
EDITOR  - Full qualified RFS File ID
EDITOR  - Column numbers
EDITOR  - Displayed messages from the Editor
EDITOR
EDITOR  There are informational lines that let you know you have
EDITOR  reached "*** TOP OF DATA ***" or "*** BOTTOM OF DATA ***".
EDITOR
EDITOR  The line which starts with "COMMAND ===>" is the Command
EDITOR  Line where Editor commands can be entered or Editor macros
EDITOR  can be invoked. The line immediately below the Command
EDITOR  Line is concidered the "current line". This "current line"
EDITOR  is highlighted and is significant for certain Editor
EDITOR  commands.
EDITOR
EDITOR  The Data Lines area of the screen is used to display and
EDITOR  edit your data. Each line in the Data Area contains a
EDITOR  "prefix area" which typically displays the line number of
EDITOR  each data line. Prefix Commands may be entered in this
EDITOR  "prefix area".
EDITOR
EDITOR  Prefix Commands
EDITOR  ===============
EDITOR  Several prefix commands are provided by the Editor. These
EDITOR  commands are entered in the prefix area and give you the
EDITOR  ability to copy, move, delete and replicate lines on either
EDITOR  an individual or a consecutive block basis.
EDITOR
EDITOR  Individual Line Commands
EDITOR  ========================
EDITOR  The folloing commands work with individual lines and consist
EDITOR  of one character...
EDITOR  '/' - Specify current line in file
EDITOR  'I' - Insert a line
EDITOR  'D' - Delete a line
EDITOR  'C' - Copy a line
EDITOR  'M' - Move a line
EDITOR  'R' - Replicate a line
EDITOR  '"' - Synonym for replicate
EDITOR
EDITOR  When you enter one of these commands in the prefix area of a
EDITOR  line the command performs its respective function on that
EDITOR  line. You can also append a number to the end of the prefix
EDITOR  command. This acts as a replication factor. If number "5" is
EDITOR  appended to the "I" command five lines are inserted into the
EDITOR  file.
EDITOR
EDITOR  Consecutive Block Commands
EDITOR  ==========================
EDITOR  The following commands work with consecutive blocks of lines
EDITOR  and consist of two characters...
EDITOR  'DD' - Delete a block of lines
EDITOR  'CC' - Copy a block of lines
EDITOR  'MM' - Move a block of lines
EDITOR  'RR' - Replicate a block of lines
EDITOR  '""' - Synonym for block replicate
EDITOR
EDITOR  Block commands are processed in pairs. You place one command
EDITOR  in the prefix area of the first line of the block and place
EDITOR  the same command in the prefix area of the last line of the
EDITOR  block.  For example to delete a block of lines place a "DD"
EDITOR  in the prefix area of the first line of the block and a "DD"
EDITOR  in the prefix area of the last line in the block. If this
EDITOR  was done on lines 00001 and 00005 it would delete line 00001
EDITOR  through 00005 inclusive.  The only block prefix command that
EDITOR  allows a replication factor is the replicate command ('RR'
EDITOR  or '""').  The replication factor must be specified with the
EDITOR  first 'RR' replication command.
EDITOR
EDITOR  Destination Commands
EDITOR  ====================
EDITOR  The following commands are called destination commands...
EDITOR  'A' - After
EDITOR  'B' - Before
EDITOR  'F' - Following
EDITOR  'P' - Preceding
EDITOR
EDITOR  These commands are used in conjunction with the copy and move
EDITOR  commands (both individual and consecutive block) to specify
EDITOR  the placement of the resulting copy or move function.
EDITOR
EDITOR  Command Line Commands
EDITOR  =====================
EDITOR  The syntax and description for each of the Command Line
EDITOR  commands follows...
